# Web Traffic Forecasting using Deep Learning LSTM:

**Introduction:**

Accurate forecasting of web traffic is crucial for managing online resources, optimizing server performance, and planning marketing strategies. By predicting future web traffic patterns, businesses can ensure they have the necessary infrastructure to handle peak loads, improve user experience, and allocate resources more effectively. This project aims to utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, to forecast future web traffic based on historical data.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop an LSTM-based forecasting model to predict future web traffic using historical traffic data. By leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the data, the model will forecast web traffic trends and fluctuations. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can aid in capacity planning, enhance user experience, and support strategic decision-making related to website management and marketing efforts.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project has 4,896 records and has the following columns:

(i)  Hour Index

(ii) Sessions

**Project Description:**

• Performed data exploration and preprocessing prior to model building.

• Developed, compiled, and trained an LSTM model to forecast web traffic.

• Implemented model checkpointing to save and load the best-performing model.

• Forecasted web traffic using the developed model.

**Observation:**

• Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.016.
